# Bachelor-Thesis
## Fake News Detection and Analysis in German

What this thesis aims for: 
1. Analysis of the Linguistic Makeup of German Fake News (using the Python3 Libraries Pandas and spaCy)
2. Assessing the Performance of Off-The-Shelf Classification Algorithms Regarding
   the Differentiation of Fake News and Legitimate News (using scikit-learn)

The first goal concerns the files crawl_articles.py, get_URLs_GermanFakeNC.py, and (most importantly) spacy_analysis.ipynb.
The second goal concerns only the file prediciton.ipynb.

The thesis uses two datasets: [GermanFakeNC](https://zenodo.org/record/3375714) and ["FNDatasetGerman"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/astoeckl/fake-news-dataset-german). If you choose to run the code yourself, simply download the datasets and place them into the datasets/ directory. 

In the thesis disputation the results are briefly described.
